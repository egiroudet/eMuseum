<h2> What is a language ?</h2>
<p> Everyone agrees that English, French, Spanish, Japanese or Arabic, and many more, are languages. However, it is more difficult to give a sufficiently general definition of language than it encompasses them all at once. Many linguists have been working on this definition for hundreds of years, and if one were to retain one short enough to retain it, one could say that a language is an instrument of communication by which human experience is analyzed. . Its codes are different in each community and are various elements of syntax and phonic expression. A language must therefore fulfill two functions: that of communication and that of identification and belonging to a community. Indeed, if you travel to a country that does not speak your language and you meet another tourist who speaks it, there is a good chance that this simple common point will create a bond between you.
Based on this definition, UNESCO, nations educational, scientific and cultural organization, which is a branch of the United Nations, has listed a total of about 7,000 languages ​​spoken in the world today. This list mainly includes regional languages: only 141 languages ​​are the official languages ​​of countries. There is no minimum number of speakers to be considered a language. UNESCO has stated that any language that is the native language of at least one individual on Earth can be listed in the directory. </p>

<h2> Evolution of the distribution of languages </h2>
<p>

It is normal that, just like populations, languages ​​appear and disappear. The disappearance of languages ​​is not a new phenomenon but has always existed in history. The two problems we face today are the lack of emergence of languages ​​and the extremely rapid disappearance. How to explain these two phenomena?

First, a language is theoretically created when a group of people are in contact long enough to develop a sense of community and choose to keep a distance from other groups. Today, in our ultra-connected world, it is much more difficult to isolate yourself in a group long enough to no longer be under the cultural and administrative influence of anyone than it was several thousand ago. 'years.
</p><p> However, a few languages ​​continue to appear, for example modern Hebrew which was made by the State of Israel to reconstruct the identity of its people, or Esperanto, a language having vocation to be easier to learn than English for anyone in the world. Its effectiveness has been proven especially in concentration camps during the Second World War, where communities of different nationalities found themselves locked up together: learning Esperanto allowed them to communicate together.

Theoretically, it is therefore normal that today many languages ​​are disappearing. But how does this theory translate into reality?
UNESCO, in its repertoire of 7000 languages, has been warning for many years about the danger in which many find themselves. The organization thus identifies more than 2000 endangered languages. In his report, we also observe that the 13 most widely spoken languages ​​in the world share 5.5 billion speakers, which means that 0.1% of languages ​​are spoken by 58% of humanity.
Terralinguia, an NGO for the defense of regional languages, announces in parallel that according to its estimates only 10% of the languages ​​spoken today will still exist in 100 years, that is to say a disappearance of more than 6000 languages.


</p><p>
If for a long time everyone viewed the disappearance of languages ​​favorably, today we are seeing the beginnings of a change in opinion. In France, for example, after several centuries of linguistic centralization and the fight against regional languages, the State finally recognized regional languages ​​a few years ago as part of French heritage. This status will not prevent them from dying on their own, but at least it means that the government realizes their preciousness.
However, too few large-scale initiatives are taken and many continue to dream of an international language like Esperanto, often without being aware of the consequences that such a phenomenon could have.</p><p>It is for this reason that we have chosen to publish this site, which allows both to be informed and to fight concretely, even if weakly, against the disappearance of languages.
