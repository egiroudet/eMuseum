<h1 style:underline;> Who are we ?</h1>
<p>For the moment, the collective is only made of myself, a 2nd year student at Sciences Po Bordeaux.</p>
<p> I created and coded this website to share a project that is very close to my heart, that of making people aware of the danger of the disappearance of languages, especially regional languages; and why not help my scale to preserve them.
This initiative is part of my final Writing and Rhetoric project. </p>
 <p>The website is still in the early stages, but it is intended to continue to evolve and be available online for as long as possible. It will never include a lucrative dimension or ads, but any volunteer help is welcome.
To learn more about this project, you can click <a href="informations.html">here</a>. </p>
